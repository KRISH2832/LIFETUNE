## Problem Statement
Many diseases, such as cancer, have significantly better prognoses when detected in early stages. However, traditional diagnostic methods can be expensive, invasive, or lack sensitivity. This project aims to address these challenges by developing advanced AI-powered diagnostic tools that improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection, leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes.

## Key Features
1. **Self-service Health Assessments**: Users can upload medical scans (e.g., CT, MRI, X-ray) and receive AI-powered analysis for the detection of various health conditions, including kidney abnormalities, brain tumors, lung cancer, and tuberculosis.
2. **Accessible Information and Resources**: Each analysis page provides comprehensive explanations of potential conditions, including causes, symptoms, and treatment options, empowering users with knowledge.
3. **AI Medical Assistant and Doctor Booking**: Users can receive clarifications and answers to queries through an AI medical assistant and seamlessly book appointments with relevant healthcare professionals for confirmed diagnosis and follow-up care.

## Technology Stack
- Streamlit for building the front-end application
- Microsoft Azure AI Custom Vision for training and deploying the AI models
- Microsoft Azure Logic App for automated email notifications
- Cloudflare AI Workflow for the AI medical assistant
- Kintone for securely storing and managing doctor information
- TinyMCE for the rich text editor (under development)
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

### Local setup:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run Logout.py
```
