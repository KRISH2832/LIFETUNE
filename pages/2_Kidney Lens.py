It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts. One theory suggests that kidney cysts develop when the surface layer of the kidney weakens and forms a pouch. The pouch then fills with fluid, detaches and develops into a cyst.
"""
cystsymptoms = """
Simple kidney cysts rarely cause trouble, but growing giants can stir. If a cyst balloons, expect lurking aches in your back or side, feverish whispers, or pangs in your upper abdomen. Don't wait for a chorus of complaints - consult a doctor if any solo symptom starts singing too loud.
"""
cysttreat = """
If symptomatic, treatment for a simple kidney cyst may involve piercing and draining with a scarring solution, using a thin needle to drain and shrink the cyst, or surgery for larger cysts. Surgery is uncommon for simple cysts but may be considered for complex cysts with potential cancerous changes.

stonecauses = """Kidney stones often have no definite, single cause, although several factors may increase your risk. Kidney stones form when your urine contains more crystal-forming substances â€” such as calcium, oxalate and uric acid â€” than the fluid in your urine can dilute. At the same time, your urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together, creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form."""

stonesymptoms = """Kidney stones are often asymptomatic until they move within the kidney or into the ureters. If lodged, they can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and lead to symptoms like abdominal and groin pain, painful urination, and more. Additional signs may include discolored urine, cloudy or foul-smelling urine, increased frequency, nausea, vomiting, and fever if infection is present. The pain's location and intensity may vary as the stone progresses through the urinary tract.
"""
stonetreat = """
Kidney stones may require treatments like shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or surgery, depending on size and complications. ESWL uses sound waves to break stones, lasting 45-60 minutes, with potential side effects. Surgery options include percutaneous nephrolithotomy for large stones and ureteroscopy for smaller ones. In cases of calcium phosphate stones due to hyperparathyroidism, surgery addresses gland issues or associated conditions to prevent stone formation.

It's not clear what causes most kidney cancers. 
Doctors know that kidney cancer begins when some kidney cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to grow and divide rapidly. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can extend beyond the kidney. Some cells can break off and spread (metastasize) to distant parts of the body."""

Surgical options include radical nephrectomy, removing the entire kidney, and partial nephrectomy, removing the tumor and a small margin of surrounding healthy tissue.
